        <h1>"Whispers of the Night"</h1><hr>
        <p>Beneath the sky of stars so bright,<br>
        The moon whispers soft into the night.<br>
        Waves of dreams, they ebb and flow,<br>
        Guiding hearts where they wish to go.<br>
        In silence deep, the world does rest,<br>
        All is calm, and all is blessed.</p>
