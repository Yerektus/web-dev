        <p id="describtion">Japan is a country where ancient traditions harmoniously coexist with modern technologies. Here you can see quiet Shinto temples and Buddhist pagodas next to ultramodern skyscrapers. Japan is known for its unique culture, respect for nature and the changing seasons, especially beautiful during cherry blossom. Traveling in Japan allows you to get acquainted with a special way of life, which values order, aesthetics and attention to detail.</p>
